I build and explore everything about the human connection and human consciousness. 

My ethos:
- learn at a high velocity - speed and direction both matter
- fail fast, then reflect and grow
- don't compare; everyone was dealt with different cards, so focus on your own hand
- optimize for the experience, not the outcome
- keep a beginner's mindset and stay humble
- life is an adventure, and love is a conscious choice
- be exotic, be iconic!
