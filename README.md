I build and explore everything about the human connection and human consciousness. 

My ethos:
‣ learn at a high velocity - speed and direction both matter;
‣ fail fast, learn faster;
‣ don't compare; everyone was dealt a different set of cards, so focus on your own hand;
‣ optimize for the experience, not the outcome;
‣ maintain a beginner's mindset and embrace humility;
‣ life is an adventure, and love is a conscious choice;
‣ be exotic, be iconic!
